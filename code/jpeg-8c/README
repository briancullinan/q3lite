The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software


This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
method for full-color and gray-scale images.

This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless
processes defined in the standard.

We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
The library is intended to be reused in other applications.

In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
library if not required for a particular application.

We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between
different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple
applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.

The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.

We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.


LEGAL ISSUES


We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
understand the innards of the JPEG software.

The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
	Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
available at http://www.ijg.org/files/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually
a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
and it may not be used for commercial purposes.

A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
at a full implementation, you've got one here...

The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still
Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.
Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.
Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG
standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).
Although this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition of
JPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an explanation
of the most essential properties and algorithms of the underlying DCT
technology.
If you think that you know about DCT-based JPEG after reading this book,
then you are in delusion.  The real fundamentals and corresponding potential
of DCT-based JPEG are not publicly known so far, and that is the reason for
all the mistaken developments taking place in the image coding domain.

The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual
specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is
titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.
IJG JPEG 8 introduces an implementation of the JPEG SmartScale extension
which is specified in a contributed document at ITU and ISO with title "ITU-T
JPEG-Plus Proposal for Extending ITU-T T.81 for Advanced Image Coding", April
2006, Geneva, Switzerland.  The latest version of the document is Revision 3.

The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
1.02.  JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report
and thus received a formal publication status.  It is available as a free
download in PDF format from
http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm.
A PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at
http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at
http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.

The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from
http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision
of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.

Thank to Andrew Finkenstadt for hosting the ijg.org site.

Last but not least special thank to Thomas G. Lane for the original
design and development of this singular software package.


FILE FORMAT WARS
================

The ISO JPEG standards committee actually promotes different formats like
"JPEG 2000" or "JPEG XR" which are incompatible with original DCT-based
JPEG and which are based on faulty technologies.  IJG therefore does not
and will not support such momentary mistakes (see REFERENCES).
We have little or no sympathy for the promotion of these formats.  Indeed,
one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help
force convergence on common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.
Don't use an incompatible file format!
(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG
image files indefinitely.)


TO DO
=====

Version 8 is the first release of a new generation JPEG standard
to overcome the limitations of the original JPEG specification.
More features are being prepared for coming releases...
